# Jira-Full-Dark-CSS-Theme
Jira Full Dark theme for the Stylish browser plugin.  

This theme is based on Bejamin Bagley's excellent "Jira Dark Flat" theme. Benjamin's theme is the best I'd found yet, but it leaves a few elements in Bitbucket and JIRA with a white background, and it doesn't retain the custom header color defined on my JIRA server. This theme corrects both of those behaviors.

If you find any display issues with this theme, please consider submitting a pull request.  

Enjoy!
